// no longer exist on the server, so import() rejects and every button that
// lazy-loads a print/report module (e.g. escposBaggagePrinting,
// escposMarketingPrinting) fails with a "Failed to fetch dynamically
// imported module" error that has nothing to do with the feature itself.

// already executing in memory keeps running untouched; only a fresh
// navigation picks up the new bundle. Without this listener, every fix
// shipped in a deploy is invisible to anyone who already had the app open
// (which, for an installed PWA people leave running for days, is the
// common case) until they think to manually force-close and reopen it.

  // -- reloading then just restarts the cold-start fetch/parse for no
