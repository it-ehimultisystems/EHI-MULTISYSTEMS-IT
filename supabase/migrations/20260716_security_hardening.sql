-- ============================================================
-- SECURITY HARDENING — close every gap found in a full audit of
-- RLS coverage, the deactivated-user path, and cross-hub exposure.
-- Safe to re-run (DROP POLICY IF EXISTS / CREATE OR REPLACE throughout).
-- ============================================================
--
-- Three separate problems, fixed together because they compound:
--
-- 1. Nine tables were created with NO RLS enabled at all: corporate_clients,
--    corporate_route_rates, pricing_config, standard_cargo_rates,
--    driver_trips, trip_pings, fleet_vehicles, fuel_logs, routing_hubs.
--    The Supabase anon key is bundled client-side by design (same as any
--    anon key) -- on a table with RLS off, that key reads/writes every
--    row and column directly via the REST API, with zero regard for what
--    the app's own UI shows or restricts. corporate_clients/
--    corporate_route_rates is the worst of these: negotiated per-client
--    freight rates and running debt balances, fully exposed.
--
-- 2. Deactivating a staff member (user_profiles.active = false) was only
--    checked at signIn() -- an already-issued session/refresh token kept
--    working through every RLS policy indefinitely, since none of them
--    checked `active` either. Fixed once, centrally: current_user_hub_id()
--    and current_user_role() (the SECURITY DEFINER helpers every hub-scoped
--    policy in 20260708_hub_isolation_rls.sql calls) now both return NULL
--    for a deactivated user, which correctly fails every dependent policy
--    closed without having to touch each of those policies individually.
--    A deactivated user can still read their OWN user_profiles row (that
--    policy checks auth.uid() = id directly, unaffected by this change) --
--    intentional, since the client needs that read to detect `active:
--    false` and force a sign-out (see src/lib/auth.ts getSession()).
--
-- 3. bank_reconciliations and proof_of_delivery had RLS enabled but with
--    "USING (true) TO authenticated" -- any staff member at any hub could
--    read every other hub's bank reconciliation runs and delivery proofs
--    (signatures/photos/GPS/ID numbers). Tightened to match how the app
--    actually gates these features client-side.
--
-- Also included: the public /track page's anon-role access is made
-- explicit and column-restricted at the database level (see bottom
-- section) -- it was previously relying entirely on the app's own
-- .select() column list for column restriction, which a direct REST call
-- bypassing the app entirely could ignore completely.
-- ============================================================

-- ============================================================
-- PART 1 — deactivated users lose access everywhere, automatically
-- ============================================================

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.current_user_hub_id()

-- is_hub_unrestricted() is unchanged (defined in 20260708_hub_isolation_rls.sql)
-- but automatically inherits this fix since it calls current_user_role().

-- in the dashboard that was never captured in a migration; this section
-- makes that access explicit, in-repo, and -- critically -- restricted to
-- exactly the columns the app displays via column-level GRANTs, not just
-- the app's own .select() list. PostgREST resolves an unqualified
-- select=* into the full column list from its schema cache and Postgres
-- rejects any column beyond what's been granted, so a handcrafted request
-- against the REST API directly (bypassing the app's column choices
-- entirely) still can never retrieve amount, receipt_mode, bank,
-- entered_by, scanned_by_name, etc. RLS below only controls which ROWS
-- anon can see; the REVOKE/GRANT pair is what actually caps the columns.
